# parser/compiler - tpc

This project aims to create a thinker and a compiler for the "tpc" a subset of the C languages. <br>
This is a university project for compilation and syntactic analysis courses, we use a subset of C languages to allow the project to last for 1 year.

## parser

For the syntactic analysis we use flex and bison, in the files parseur.lex and gram.y

## compilation

For compilation, we compile to the arm64 language.
